						This project started off with a completely different idea that was soon abandoned. The first project proposal was to make an app that challenges your perception of size. Unfortunately, because the project should be about Augmented Reality and we could not find any real application for the use of AR in the project, it was scrapped and we came up with something else. It did however lay the foundations and helped us come up with ideas for what was later to become sARkofag, and it's features. In short, it all started with a <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/banana-for-scale" target="_blank">banana</a>.

						The first prototype of sARkofag was put together extremely quickly as an exploit of how the camera planes are handled in 3d graphics, but it actually convinced us that this could really be done, and that there is use of AR in this context. The basic idea all boils down to being able to see what is inside of another object, without opening it physically. The app lets you sneak peak inside of an object, without touching it. See but not touch, level 2!

					<h1>Further developement, and building from scratch again</h1>

				<div class="col-sm-12">
					<p>
						We had a working demo, but now we wanted to do some real mesh cutting, so Ingemar began developement on a shader based implementation with some clever rendering order modifications. The first version worked something like this:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class="list-group-item">1: Render a sphere to the Z-buffer (but not to the color buffer) near the camera with position and size relative to the distance to the camera and the position of the sarcophagus. Usually. Everything rendered right after this will be rendered "around but not in" the sphere circle. 
						<li class="list-group-item">2: Move the video screen layer close to the camera view port, and render it to both the color and the Z-buffer. Usually, objects are only rendered if it is closer to the camera than the already closest rendered object. Because the sphere from step 1 might be closer to the camera than the video, there might be a hole in the video now.</li> 
						<li class="list-group-item">3: Render the (soon to be) sarcophagus box.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">4: Render a sphere far away in the distance (and dont consult the Z-buffer), with its' size relative to the distance to the camera and the position of the sarcophagus. This will overwrite the video and box layer with a black circle.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">5: Render the box inside the sarcophagus</li>
					</ul>								
					<p>
						This solution was not that very flexible, but it shed some light over the problem. The goal was to make it a two layer solution, where everything regarding the sarcophagus and its contents could be rendered with standard (or custom translucency) shaders in the regular geometry pass, which could make for future modification of the model without having to rewrite the whole rendering order for the mesh cutting.

						After finishing the first prototype of rendering setup, analyzing pros and cons of it, and thinking with pen and paper, a few modifications was made. The complexity was reduced to only using one depth mask sphere, and actually removing the front depth mask took away the black circle, giving the impression that two layer solution we were striving for. The prototype now performed according to our specifications. Ingemar was pleased. But still no banana.

						We then sat down and had a brain storm about what we wanted to show in the app, and how it should look and feel. We also thought about and discussed what controls to have and where to put them. It turned into this scetch. We wanted to be able to switch between different layers of the mummy, so a slider were planned for this. We also wanted to keep the ability to cut through the different layers and switch back and forth to the looking glass, so of course we needed a big green/red button. We also wanted to try something a bit different, so the controls were "placed on the table" next to the sarcophagus. An idea was that we could do some clever image recognition and detect an arm in the picture pushing the Augmented button on the table physically. But when thinking a bit more, it would be quite difficult to actually use it, so it was left for future studies.

						We needed a mummy, a "something" inside of the mummy, the sarcophagus and some treasures that would be inside of it. In short one could say there were two runs in the modeling phase, where a first tier of the absolute nessessary models were created, and then a remake of them were done to the final version. They were either based off free-to-use models or created from scratch using a mix of programs, among others Blender, Maya, Photoshop and for the custom materials Erik M took a deep dive into Substance Designer, which is an extremely powerful program for creating realistic materials based on either the usual way with textures, or generating textures based of physical simulations.

						We did not forgotten about the banana, and for the record it hides out in the final release of the executable (try finding it)! Logic were written for connecting the UI controls to the switching of layers, and it might sound like a big history skip, but after some few hours of testing and the obvious fixing of obvious bugs, we came to the point we are today. It might have been thanks to Unity being kind enough to cooperate with GIT in very controlled manners, but there were never really any collisions that took preacious time to fix. Below you can see the demonstration of the final app.
