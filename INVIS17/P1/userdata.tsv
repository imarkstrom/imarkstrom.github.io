2	Aragorn	I have been an aviation enthusiast since I was a kid, although I do not hold a pilot's license (yet). I enjoy cooking and I try to follow a healthy lifestyle with regular physical activity, such as cycling, running or team sports, mostly football. I have developed an increasing interest in all sorts of water-sports over the past few years, mostly in free-diving and surfing. I have an appreciation for all art forms but I am far from being an art-savvy. 	I am working on several personal projects that I expect to translate into business ideas. A good design is a key point for the success of these ideas, so I expect that I can apply what I learn in this course to seduce potential users with a jaw-dropping representation of data.	5	4	3	6	7	3	1	4	8
3	Arwen		How to design systems which are more user-centered.	3	3	3	3	8	8	3	3	3

Otherwise I've recently started going to events/hackatons in my spare time. Mostly related to helping organisations develop ideas and prototypes by the use of technology. Also looking forward to the Crash Bandicoot on PS4 game release!	Learn: New programming skills, new softwares, learning different visualization methods, being able to more easily see what model is most relevant for showing the data. Teambuilding. Future: Use it when analyzing and selling. I want to run my own business some day and this is a great tool to have. 	4	4	5	6	10	7	7	6	7
7	Bilbo	JavaScript interests me. Alongside my education, I like to work on freelance projects to pay my bills and open source projects to give back.

I think information visualisation is a powerful tool (that is on the rise) in order to help people understand different kinds of connections and causes. Especielly in a world of big data, this feels really relevant. I expect to learn how to present information depending on the data, i.e. what kind of data you have determines how you visualise it - not all kinds of data fits in the same kind of visualisation.	7	6	5	6	8	4	1	6	7
15	Damrod		I want to learn more about how to use visualization as a tool in interaction design and improve my skills in simplifying, personalizing and presenting data.

I want to create stuff that people can benefit from, and hopefully make the world somewhat of a better place. 	As of today, there is "some slight misuse" of everything from statistic data to pure crappy data representations out in our society. After this course I want to be able to choose a good way of visualizing data (useful for more than my graduation work..) and also being able to interpret other peoples visualizations. My artistic skills are not that great, and getting a push here and practicing might be a healthy bonus.	5	5	7	4	9	9	8	4	3

32	Galadriel	I have been working a programmer in the mobile space for the past 4 years before I joined master school here at KTH. I am extremely interested in how programming plays its role in creating art forms and that design married with technology can produce amazing experiences. I play basketball and enjoy equestrian sports a lot. I code on hobby projects when I am free and that had led me to pursue a startup earlier as well.	I intend to understand and produce brilliant information projects that can be used to understand the knowledge that is there over the internet. I intend to apply and publish information that is meaningful. I have tried to present such information from twitter feed etc but I have lacked in creating truly relevant and meaningful content. I hope to review and correct my short comings.	7	5	6	7	9	8	7	8	5

36	Gollum	When people ask me what interests me, I often answer saying that I am inherently curious. With that I mean I'm interest in basically everything that crosses my path, from science to arts to stupid internet things. Now, on a deeper level, academically speaking, I like to think about how technology and society interact, how this things we create end up shaping us. in fact that is the reason I left Brazil to study here.  As for hobbies, in my spare time lately I have been trying to learn how to code (basically JavaScript and HTML). Also, I am passionate about music (I used to play guitar and violin) and in the past months I have grown an interest on cooking. 	I have 2 goals in the course. The first one is to understand how aesthethics and design can help people make sense of the huge amount of data we generate every second. The other is more technical, to learn tools to create such graphics and visualizations.	4	2	2	4	9	1	1	1	6
37	Gorbag	I did my Bachelor in Computer Engineering and worked for almost 3 years as a software developer. Even though I love programming, I realised that programming on a topic that I have no interest in, is really depressing. So I applied to KTH and moved to Stockholm to learn more about a topic I'm interested on programming.  I like playing video games in my free time. I can be found browsing Steam for survival, city-building games or indie games. I follow most of AAA titles too. I also watch movies, tv-series and read books. And recently, I got inspirited by a book I've read and started baking cookies (random :) ) . 	I find the idea of transforming a huge data to easily understandable and visually stunning graphics really interesting. I want to learn how to make visualizations, how to group the data, learn about the related math topics and make visulalizations that can chance people's perspectives and mindsets.  I think that visulization can be used for almost anything since everything can be used as data. I don't know if I will be inspired enough to use it in personal projects but I want to :) I would love to learn how to use visulization in my future work too.	5	2	5	5	9	7	3	6	3

Other than that I like to paint (everything from walls to sketching a Disney character), used to play football but injuries happen so had to quit. 	What type of visualization goes with what "kind" of data, how you should think in terms of inteded users/audience. How to program interactive programs and using for example D3.js. <- very interested in that part, you can make some cool things. I think I will be able to use everything I learn in this course in future projects and later at work.	6	5	5	7	7	4	2	5	6

I want to learn how to make an intuitive, well-designed representation of information that is of course visualized. I think what is learnt here can be used in many different contexts. I see that's it's about making sense of data, and in for example counter strike global offensive, you have lots of data that you can get from the game demos but the ways of representing it is limited. 	3	5	4	3	10	6	2	7	5

I am also helping small companies with logos and some printed material. In my spare time I work in a mens clothing store, I travel as much as I can and I also try to photograph as much as I can on my travels. I have an older brother that I think you might recognize a graduated KTH student whos visualization skills I'm trying to learn from. 	My expectation is to learn how to use my graphic design skills in combination with programming in order to create the visualization ideas that I have but not have the tools to create. I also hope to get a glimps in web design, and how to create websites.	3	3	5	8	8	2	3	3	3

66	Shagrat	Sports, movies and tv-series, art.	To learn how to present data in a estethically and interactive way. Hopefully this could be used when presenting research results in future projects and work. 	3	3	5	6	7	2	1	1	4
